       <p>Hi, my name is Kuldeep Yadav, I am a software engineer in small startup in Gurugram, India. In my career of of almost 8 years, I have worked upon various frameworks, languages and databases. I love to build new things from scratch and see how a product shape up from zero like a tree germinates from seed.</p>
